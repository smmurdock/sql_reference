-- WHAT ARE SUBQUERIES?

-- Subqueries are queries within queries. A subquery can also be called an inner query with the "parent" query being called the outer query.
-- Reasons you may need to use a subquery 
-- Criteria for a WHERE clause is not specifically known
-- You need a temporary data set to join with other tables in your database

-- Structure Example:
SELECT <columns>
FROM <table 1>
WHERE Column1 IN (
    SELECT Column1 
    FROM Table 2 
    WHERE <search criteria>
);


-- There are two main ways to use a subquery:
-- In an IN condition
-- As a derived or temporary table

-- A subquery in an IN condition must only have one column:
SELECT <columns> FROM <table 1> WHERE <table 1>.<column> IN (<subquery>);
SELECT <columns> FROM <table 1> 
    WHERE <table 1>.<column> IN (SELECT <a single column> FROM <table 2> WHERE <condition>);

-- Examples:
-- Get a list of user's names and emails for users who have spent over 100 dollars in a single transaction:

SELECT name, email FROM users 
    WHERE id IN (SELECT DISTINCT(user_id) FROM sales WHERE saleAmount > 100);

-- OR

SELECT name, email FROM users
    INNER JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT(user_id) FROM sales WHERE saleAmount > 100) AS best_customers
    ON users.id = best_customers.user_id;

-- Get a list of user's names and emails for users who have spent over 1000 dollars in total:
SELECT name, email FROM users WHERE id IN (SELECT user_id FROM sales WHERE SUM(saleAmount) > 1000 GROUP BY user_id);

-- OR

SELECT name, email, total FROM users 
    INNER JOIN (SELECT user_id, SUM(saleAmount) AS total FROM sales WHERE total > 1000 GROUP BY user_id) AS ultimate_customers
    ON users.id = ultimate_customers.user_id;
